Project Folder: Zlhbz/work_day_scheduler/

Brief description of submitted files:

index.html --> enables the website to get data from moment.js. It also enables to use bootstrap and jquery. Most of the elements of the website were created through script.js so index.html file only includes few elements as header.  

script.js --> Most of the required element(as 8 rows for 8 working hours, buttons etc.) and functions needed were done through this file. First function arranges the elements in the website. Second function gets the input and stores it in the local storage. The last one displays the all data in the local storage related to the schedule.


style.css --> External css file describes how HTML and jquery elements should be displayed.  8 textareas were designed to enable the user to take notes for each work hour. Color gray represents hours passed, red represents present time and green represents future hours in a day.
